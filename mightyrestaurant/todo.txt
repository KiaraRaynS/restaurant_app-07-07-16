- Make CreateViews for both Owner and Server
- Make a new model table called Table
    * new table id is generated when taking new order so all new orders will be that table
    * A server can go back to a table and edit it to add or delete orders
    * Orders will have a foreign key to table
    * table total is calculated by adding together all the orders costs
    * Instead of being filtered by paid or not tables are filtered by being marked as finished
        [so one may order another item after they pay and realize they want more]

- For Owner:
    * Edit index view so instead of getting a list of all menu items its a list of categories
    * Clicking a category will bring a list of all menu items withing that category

- For Server:
    * Edit index view to be a list of current tables instead of current orders
        - Each table will have a small list of orders related to table and cook status
            ex: [pizza (cooked)]
        - Clicking on a table will give a detailed view of orders, pay option, and finish button
